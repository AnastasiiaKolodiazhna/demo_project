                            to a height of 15 meters, forming around itself a “mini-volcano” of mineral sediments. Scientists say that something like this looked like the surface of our planet millions of years ago. The geyser is located on the territory
                            of a private ranch, and to admire it, you need permission of the owner. But tourists do not stop. People believe that if you wash water from a geyser, life will be bright and happy.</p>

                            belonged to the tower with reverent horror, because at the top many times observed strange light phenomena. There is a legend that the devil sits on the top and beats the drum, causing thunder. Due to bad reputation mountain

                            experienced fate: he dived into deep pools, jumping through precipices. One day he decided to check whether it was true that the rays of the sun are deadly for trolls. At dawn, he stuck out his tongue from his cave and ...
                            was petrified forever. The rock like a magnet attracts modern adventurers: sit on the edge, make a flip, take a picture. There is no troll, but his work lives!</p>

                        <p class="card-text">130 km from London, in the county of Wiltshire, is a fancy building of huge stone blocks. This is one of the most popular archaeological sites in the world. The researchers found that the construction of the complex lasted almost
                            two thousand years and took place in several stages. However, it is still unclear who built it and why. According to folk legend, the huge blue stones have magical powers, and the building was erected by a wizard named Merlin.
                            There is also a version that Stonehenge is a stone age observatory, a Druid sanctuary or an ancient tomb.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">In Yosemite National Park, on the eastern slope of Mount El Capitan, there is a 650-meter waterfall. Most of the year, it is unremarkable, but in February, the falling streams of water turn into "lava flows." An amazing natural
                            phenomenon is due to the fact that at sunset the sun's rays are reflected in the waterfall, creating a visual illusion that the red-hot metal flows down from the rock. According to legend, on the top of the mountain was the
                            home of a blacksmith, who made the best horseshoes for horses in the area. But because of the heavy rain, the smithy was washed off the cliff. Since then, the waterfall once a year "reminds" of this tragic event.</p>

                            the torso smoothly passes into an elongated neck with small tubercles. There are quite a few people who claim to have seen the Loch Ness monster. More than three thousand cases have been recorded. There is even a photo and
                            video footage. But there are enough skeptics. The debate about whether there is a monster in the lake lasts for decades, and from time to time it flares up with a new force.</p>

                            during the ice age. When the ocean level rose, the cave roof collapsed and a karst crater formed. But there is an opinion that flooding could not provoke destruction - too big sizes, too correct round shape. There should have
                            been an external impact, for example, the fall of a meteorite.</p>
